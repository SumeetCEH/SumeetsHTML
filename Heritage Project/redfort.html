    <p>The Red Fort, locally known as Lal Qila, is a historic fort in the city of Delhi in India. Constructed in 1639 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors for nearly 200 years. The fort represents the peak of Mughal creativity, which, under the Shah Jahan period, reached its zenith. Every year on India's Independence Day (15th August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech. Its stunning architecture and symbolic importance make it one of India's most treasured monuments.</p>
