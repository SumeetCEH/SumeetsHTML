            The Taj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
            Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
            this ivory-white marble mausoleum is a symbol of eternal love. 
            Located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, it was completed in 1653 and is known for its stunning architecture, 
            detailed carvings, beautiful gardens, and the iconic white domes.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and remains one of the most visited tourist attractions in India. 
            The Taj Mahalâ€™s beauty is most breathtaking at sunrise and sunset, where the changing light gives it different colors.
